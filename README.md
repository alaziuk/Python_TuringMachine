## 🎋 Intro: <br>
This is a simple Turing Machine implemented in python. It is a project for my course. The purpose of this code is to simulate the operation of a Turing Machine based on instructions read from a file. 

## 📦 Tech Stack:  <br>
It is using ABC (Abstract Base Classes) and MaszynaTuringa class which inherits from Absracyjna_MaszynaTuringa and provides concrete implementation.

## 👩🏽‍🍳 Features:  <br>
It features insturkcja.txt file where instruction for TuringMashine are. The instruction are: <br>
First line: input string (string that we will operate on) in my example there is: ala_ma_kota_a_kot_ma_ale% <br>
Second line: alphabet (it cannot contain state names) <br>
The rest: states and instructions.

## 💭 Process:  <br>
It was fun but a bit short.

## 📚 Learnings:  <br>
I learned how to use decorators, operate on files and how to inherit class.

## ✨ Improvement:  <br>
The code could definitely be improved. I honestly don't know how but I know it could be done.

## 🚦 Running the Project:  <br>
1. Clone Repository
2. Change instructions to your liking
3. Run Maszyna_Turinga.py
